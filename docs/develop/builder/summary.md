# Builder Summary

The Builder is a tool designed for constructing LinguFlow application logic using a [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) approach. With a basic understanding of `Blocks` and `Lines`, you can quickly create an LinguFlow application.

## Basic

Within the Builder interface, you can:
- Export the existing Blocks and Lines as a `.yaml` file. The export process anonymizes any keys.
- Import an existing `.yaml` file and visualize it.
- Save the current content.
- Publish a saved version.

## Information

The bottom right corner of the Builder interface displays essential information, including the application name and version name.

Clicking the `info` button reveals detailed information:
- App Name & App ID
- Version Name & Version ID, where you can modify the version name.
